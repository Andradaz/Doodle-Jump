# Name: Up
# Character: Kitten
# Description: Inspired by Doodle-Jump game (http://poki.com/en/g/doodle-jump) , "Up" is a cute kitty aiming to reach the clouds. Carefully jumping on each platform, she wants a lot of points. 

# Join Up in her adventure. Just type your name and start! 
# Using Lists and Trees, Up stores your score in her DataBase. Each time you want to see the scoreboard, she reads it from a FileText. First she tried to make a Linked List but it took a lot of time to make some operations like sorting, searching a specific element, so she used a Binary Search Tree too and it was worth it!
